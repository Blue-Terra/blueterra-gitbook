# ðŸŒŠ Blue Terra

## Overview&#x20;

Blue Terra is the worldâ€™s first NFT tied to plots of physical land (LaN). We aim to be the first IRL `DAO` backed by real world assets. The purpose of this gitbook is fourfold:

1\) To serve as a friendly Hitchhiker's Guide to Blue Terra for new community members.

2\) To serve as a living document to govern the `Articles of Governance` for:

&#x20;    a. Blue Terra Home Owners Association (`HOA`)&#x20;

&#x20;    b. Blue Terra Decentralized Autonomous Organization (`DAO`)&#x20;

3\) To serve as a living ledger to record `Resolutions` from the respective members of the:

&#x20;    a. Blue Terra Home Owners Association (`HOA`)&#x20;

&#x20;    b. Blue Terra Decentralized Autonomous Organization (`DAO`)&#x20;

4\) To simplify key sections of whitepaper v0.1.1 into more easy to read sections
