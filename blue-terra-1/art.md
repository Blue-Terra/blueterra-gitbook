## Overview

At Blue Terra, ensuring that we are able to display high quality Bahamian artwork is at the core of our values. We worked hard to ensure that the art displayed in this collection was created by Bahamians for The Bahamas to stay true to our roots.&#x20;

Each piece of the collection pays homage to the culture and history of The Bahamas. For example, the flamingo is the national bird of The Bahamas, and the blue marlin is the national fish, with both being on the Bahamian coat of arms.
