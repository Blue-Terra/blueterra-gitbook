# ðŸŒ± Blue Terra Foundation Grant Program

## Grants

Upon successful mint, we will be dedicating up to $500,000 in `Business Development Grants` for our holders to build on top of Blue Terra.&#x20;

We will be distributing a portion of these grants every fiscal quarter for at least the next two years, and grant decisions are subject to a formal application and `DAO` review.&#x20;

Some projects we imagine funding are a community well / center, solar panels, cottages, bars, restaurants, gazebos, music festivals, conferences, and conventions.&#x20;

## Submitting Proposals

Any `DAO` and `HOA` member will be able to submit proposals for spending, and we will have an ongoing application process in channels such as Discord.&#x20;

The goal of the `Business Development Grant` program is to promote economic activity on Blue Terra and further develop the land.A percentage of royalties from our upcoming marketplace will also be dedicated towards this purpose.&#x20;

We want Blue Terra to simultaneously be an untouched paradise and a developed settlement in areas where it makes sense. By spurring economic activity, we hope to create self-sustainable forms of value for our holders.
