# üå≥ Conscious Capitalism

## Introduction

Capitalism has been an integral part of infrastructural development for hundreds of years. During this time, we have witnessed global advancements that revolutionized international economies.&#x20;

However, despite the benefits of global capitalism, there have been many teachable moments in how we can improve in the future.&#x20;

As we embark on a new frontier of digital capitalism, it is important to take note of what we have learned and what we can improve upon from our physical world capitalist predecessors.&#x20;

Taking a socially conscious step forward into the digital space, we will be giving back to the Bahamian community and collaborating with diverse young minds in how they imagine their future to look.&#x20;

## The Blue Terra Innovative Minds Project&#x20;

We have created the ‚ÄúThe Blue Terra Innovative Minds Project‚Äù in partnership with a local school in The Bahamas. A group of high school students will create the blueprint of what they imagine their future to look like. The project will be based off of the land that is being purchased by Blue Terra and the students will have an opportunity to explore the land. After their excursion of the land, The students will begin to write their Blue Terra Innovative Minds Blueprint.&#x20;

This blueprint will include an environmentally sustainable, bio-diverse, socially conscious and urban developed community within the parameters of Blue Terra‚Äôs land (approx. 200 acres). The students will integrate existing technology (ie. solar panels) and new creative inventions they would like to include in the island blueprint. The final Blue Terra Innovative Minds blueprint will be displayed on the Blue Terra website.&#x20;

The NFT owners will be able to use this blueprint or refer to it when choosing to build or develop on their land. The digital verse has allowed creative thinking to take on a new league of reach. Blue Terra exhibits the ability to apply innovative thinking and have it 8 materialize into the real world to affect positive change in existing industries.&#x20;

We believe in fostering creative young minds and the importance of collaborating with the youth in pioneering the future of the digital economy. Together, we have a plethora of knowledge that is derived from many different walks of life. The youthful creativity built into this blueprint will deeply reflect the world the young generation wants to live, work, develop and socially grow in.
