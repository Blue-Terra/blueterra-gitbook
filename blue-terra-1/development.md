# ðŸ›– Development

## Initial State

At the time of mint, the land is not developed on and owners are free to build on top of it.&#x20;

## Regulation

Any development is subject to the ordinary regulations that Bahamians have to abide by as detailed in [The Bahamas Building Code](https://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/wcm/connect/d7ebcbad-f9b6-42e3-aff2-79f83bd91810/Bahamas%2BBuilding%2BCode%2B3rd%2BEd.pdf?MOD=AJPERES).&#x20;

We encourage our holders to build anything they wish, although construction charges are subject to a 10% VAT. There is an electricity grid and running power lines on all the properties that we are considering, as well as a plethora of well sites, options for septic tanks, and internet infrastructure.&#x20;

## Infrastructure

Common practice in The Bahamas is to dig your own well and install your own septic tank, and we will be partnering with local companies to provide these services at a discount for our holders. We estimate that the total cost of utility installation would be between $3,000-$7,000 with small monthly fees thereafter. A contracted cottage or hut would cost around $15,000-$20,000 to construct, although sans raw material costs, these could be built for free.&#x20;

## Vision

We envision many of our holders will use their property as a camp site or special place to relax, in which case a tent, hammock, or even basic campground would be fairly inexpensive or free. Though Blue Terra fully respects property rights and the governance capacity of the `DAO`, the founders of the project envisioned a sustainable and eco-friendly community in harmony with nature.&#x20;
