# üèù Land

## Overview

Each Blue Terra NFT will be tied to approximately 1,500 - 2,000 square feet of land. The land itself itself is distributed via `Perpetual Lease` and is embedded within the metadata of the NFT.&#x20;

## Property Selection

After mint, the `DAO` will vote on the purchase of properties that Blue Terra propose.  Our team is conducting the necessary due diligence and surveyal work for several properties on:

* &#x20;Andros
* Abaco
* Crooked Island
* San Salvador
* Eleuthera
* The Exumas

The final choices for properties will depend on a number of factors: square acreage, percentage beachfront, proximity to the main islands, current population, preferences of the `DAO`, and the percent of supply that is sold.&#x20;

## Risks & Conditions

If at least 10% of the total supply is sold out, we will be able to purchase land that has an estimated size of 1500 to 2000 square feet per NFT.&#x20;

With more supply sold, we will be able to afford more square feet per plot and higher likelihood of beach exposure. If less than 10% of mint is sold, then we will refund our minters.
