# ðŸ’¸ Taxation

## Overview

Traditional models of large scale transfers of realty have struggled to scale as they tend to exhibit poor liquidity and are tax inefficient. In the traditional model, upon transfer or sale of land, one almost always needs to pay some form of initial transfer tax, for example through a stamp duty or VAT, as well as an annual property tax. Although these ranges vary, typically cumulative costs amount to 5-10%.&#x20;

## Disclaimers

In the Blue Terra model, land is anchored to the freehold `lease`, which is created and initially held by a Bahamian company. Therefore the tax liability falls on the holder of the `lease` and therefore the holder of the NFT.&#x20;

### Transfer Tax

Because our model uses `perpetual leases`, the trading of these `leases` do not trigger the typical transfer-of-ownership costs of a deed because the freehold which holds these leases is not changing ownership.&#x20;

As a result, Blue Terra NFT holders are not liable for any land tax on their land transactions in the Bahamas.&#x20;

### Property Tax

In the case where holders do chose to build on their land, they would be subject to the same construction code, property tax and 10% VAT.
