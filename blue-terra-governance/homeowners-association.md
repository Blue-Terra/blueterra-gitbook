# üèõ Homeowner's Association

## Overview

The Blue Terra Home Owners‚Äô Association (`HOA`) will be the group of holders that will be responsible for the maintenance, fees, and other responsibilities of the property.&#x20;

## Membership

To be a member of the `HOA`, holders would need to:

* Be a holder of a Blue Terra NFT (could not trade this NFT while a part of the organization).
* Fill out KYC verification.
* Be elected into the position by either one of the founders or the `DAO`.
* Be a committed community member.
* Have experience in community management or relevant fields.

## Leadership Structure

The `HOA` structure would be similar to those found in standard community organizations. The Blue Terra `HOA` will have a board of ten directors that would be responsible for overseeing and enforcing the rules and regulations of the `DAO`. At least one member of the board must be a Bahamian.&#x20;

The `HOA` members would be a part of an incorporated company under Blue Terra. The Board of Directors would first be responsible for looking at general maintenance requirements for the entire community (e.g landscaping) and setting up a system to address these needs.&#x20;

Second, the Directors would be responsible for reporting any complaints or legal issues to the relevant authorities. Third, the Directors would also oversee the way in which community finances are handled.&#x20;

## Leadership Responsibilities&#x20;

The `HOA` would also be responsible for creating monthly community updates for holders with information on the property, updates on anything revolving around the `DAO`, and resources that can help community members. The election process for our `HOA` will again, be standard. There will be a community vote for the 10 Board of Directors. The positions are one President, one Vice-President, two Secretaries, three Treasurers, and three Community Leaders.&#x20;

### Drafting Resolutions

The members of the `HOA` are responsible for drafting and reviewing `Resolutions` from the `Proposals` finalized&#x20;





There must always be a bijective relationship between `Proposals` and `Resolutions` after the \`\` has reviewed

### Property Taxes

Property taxes would be one of the most important jobs of the `HOA`. The Directors would be responsible for keeping a list of the holders developing properties versus those on undeveloped land. The Directors would annually be responsible for collecting the appropriate amount of property taxes from those developing on their plots. The Directors would also be responsible for paying those taxes to the Government of The Bahamas.&#x20;

#### Documents

There will be an `expense sheet`, publicly available to the `DAO`, in which the Directors would be responsible for making these payments. The Directors will be the only community members that are given access to KYC information, as they will be responsible for disputes amongst community members and also taxes.&#x20;



### Roles and Responsibilities&#x20;

All of these positions are equal in terms of rank and position on the Board of Directors and are better used to focus on responsibilities and primary area of concern.&#x20;

#### President and Vice President&#x20;

The President and Vice-President will be responsible for communicating serious inquiries with the Founders and providing updates. They will also be responsible for setting up Board of Director meetings.&#x20;

#### Secretaries

Secretaries will be responsible for filing all paperwork such as taxes and keeping track of the KYC database, as well as sharing that information with relevant authorities if needed.&#x20;

#### Treasurers

The Treasurers will be responsible for creating expense reports, managing the community wallet, and sharing financial information with the Founders and the holders.&#x20;

#### Community Leader

The Community Leaders will be responsible for managing the `DAO` and relaying information from community members to other Directors and the holders. It is our hope with establishing this `HOA`, that we can have a smaller-scale self-governing system in place for holders.&#x20;

### Compensation

We envision the pay structure of the `HOA` to be simple. Each Director will be paid equally from the publicly available Community wallet. Each Director will be paid 1 SOL weekly, paid bi-weekly for completion of tasks.&#x20;

This payment is subject to increase depending on market flow, community discussion, or a formal request by the Directors. The treasurers will be responsible for paying all Directors to their personal wallets, including themselves.
