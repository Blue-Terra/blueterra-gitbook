# 🇸🇬 Singapore

The long term “leasehold” agreement has been popularly used for centuries throughout various parts of the world. Singapore is a notable country that frequently uses the leasehold arrangement as a form of ownership. For example, since the Singaporian Government owns 75% of the land, the government is motivated to secure the scarce amount of land for future Singaporean generations.

&#x20;By using the “leasehold” ownership method, this enables the government to secure Singaporean owned land from foreign/domestic businesses while still profiting off the land. The concept of a “leasehold” was introduced to Singapore by English property law. “In English property law, demises of land for a term of years were considered to be dealt with by means of personal actions and hence leaseholds in English law were never considered as ‘realty’ and were free of the excessively complicated system of rules which applied to ‘real’ property...The aim was to avoid the complicated property law and create a simple system. In 1956, Singapore adopted this framework and slightly modified it to further the simplicity of the agreement.&#x20;

The ‘Torrens System’ was born by Singaporians creating a simplified system of titles for land. “The objectives of the Torrens system was to simplify titles to land and reduce the costs, to facilitate dealings in land and to secure absolute certainty of title. The intention of the legislature was to introduce a system of transfer that is simple, cheap, accurate, adaptable and expeditious." Currently, Singapore mainly offers leasehold property and/or land for 99 - 999 years. For example, Singapore has recently introduced a housing program; HDB flats. The HDB flats program allows the government to continually provide affordable new flats for future generations. A 99-year lease means that the flat can be handed down one or two generations before it is returned to the state for redevelopment.With a 99 lease expiry, the citizen will have full ownership rights to the property and can choose to renew the lease. Once the lease expires, the property is returned to the state and is renovated with new infrastructure for the next 99-year lease.&#x20;

Since 1967, all sites for private residential land in Singapore have also been sold on leases no more than 99 year. However, there are many instances where there is land that is based on an auto-renewed perpetual ongoing lease for 999 years. Blue Terra aims to laterally apply this framework through digital and physical integration. The NFT that holds the leasehold will provide the tenant full ownership rights for “x” amount of years while still maintaining the freehold ownership by a Bahamian. “In essence, this arrangement is a specialised form of financial engineering.”&#x20;

The micro-land leasehold will provide the tenant the ability to grow, develop, sell with far more “ownership” than full freehold ownership. “Land-owners do not contribute to economic growth because they do not invest in production but spend their revenue on consumption.” By having micro-leaseholds to multiple tenants with the potential to develop, the tenant can make a return on their potential business/development within the given year terms of the lease. Once the lease expires (150 years), it will be returned to the freehold corporation or the tenant can choose to renew the lease. The leasehold cases explained through Singapore exemplifies the success and value of the leasehold model. The Singapore economy continues to thrive through capitalizing on land through leaseholds.
