In June 2021, The Royal Caribbean Group (RCG) became the holder of the most recent leasehold agreement approved under the Bahamian government. This agreement gives the RCG development rights to Bahamian 7 acres of land and seabeds for the next 100 years.&#x20;

The lease agreement stipulates that the RCG must pay a rent fee to the Bahamian government of $140k annually. In exchange, the RCG will be able to develop the land into a beach club destination for its guests. The RCG estimates that this development will attract about one million tourists and will ultimately be beneficial to the Bahamian economy.&#x20;

The projected financial return into the Bahamian economy from the Royal Caribbean Beach Club is about $26M annually. Along with this revenue generation, thousands of jobs will also be created to employ Bahamian citizens. The land lease provides the ability for the RCG to build a development on Bahamian land without having foreign freehold ownership of the crown land.&#x20;

The RCG will be able to make a substantial return on the investment of the Beach Club Development and that will financially invigorate the Bahamian economy. Once the land-lease expires in 100 years, the land will be returned to the government as Bahamian Crown land. At this point in time, the Bahamian government will be able to sell the land to a Bahamian citizens or begin a new land lease for the next 100 years to come.
