# üóùÔ∏è KYC, PII Retention And Security

At Blue Terra, we have two levels of KYC.&#x20;

First, we leverage `Civic` for automated verifications of identity documents and cross references to AML and Terrorism databases.&#x20;

Second, is Blue Terra KYC where you will have to provide in depth information about you identity so that you may fulfill the Bahamian regulatory requirements on leasing.&#x20;

## I. Civic KYC

### Required Data And Documents

* Passport or ID&#x20;
* Live Face Scan

### Certifications

During this stage you will need to agree to Civic's Terms and Conditions.&#x20;

### Retention

Civic will retain your `PII` on their servers. Their data retention period is unknown.&#x20;

## II. Blue Terra KYC&#x20;

The second stage of KYC is Blue Terra KYC. At this stage Civic has verified that you have a valid form of identification, your identity documents match a selfie, and that you are not on any AML or Terrorism watchlists.&#x20;

### Requirements

For an arbitrary Blue Terra NFT holder, we are required to verify that:

* The holder is a real person, can be identified and that we store and have ready at anytime the following information:
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Place Of Birth
  * Residential Address
    * Street Address and Building Number
    * City
    * Country
    * Zip Code

### Certifications

During Blue Terra KYC, holder will be asked to certify that the following are `True` in the form of a checkbox.

1. That you agree to the terms of service of the Blue Terra HOA.
2. That all of the information that you have provided is true and correct to the best of your knowledge.
3. That you agree to allow Blue Terra and its partners to retain and share your data.&#x20;

### Retention

Blue Terra will retain your `PII` and at times copies of your blockchain interactions on our servers. All of our services are hosted on a mix of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. We will retain this information forever.&#x20;

True to the spirit of decentralization, we would rather not have a `PII` api. However after much thought, this is the only feasible way in which we can provide the regulatory bodies your information if requested in a timely manner.&#x20;
