# ðŸŒŠ DAO

## Scope

The following is the `Article of Governance` for the Blue Terra `DAO`. This is the Blue Terra `DAO` constitution. The Blue Terra `DAO` is to act in the best interest of the Blue Terra project and in the manner herein specified.&#x20;

## Overview

After our mint, we will form a decentralized autonomous organization, or `DAO`, to serve as the governing body for our NFT holders and to select the initial officers of our Home Ownerâ€™s Association(`HOA`). Members of the `DAO` can colloquially be referred to as Terrans.

We will also be dedicating a significant percentage of exchange fees from our upcoming secondary market back to the `DAO`, to give back to our community members and enable the Blue Terran `DAO` to create new value for our holders: be it through more communal land development, a validator node to stake to, marketing partnerships etc.&#x20;

## Membership

To be a member of the `DAO`, holders would need to:

* Be a holder of a Blue Terra NFT (could not trade this NFT while a part of the organization)
* Verify on Discord with Grape Protocol.

## Formation

To qualify, one will simply need to hold a Blue Terra NFT in their Solana wallet. Exclusive Discord channels will be available through Grape Protocol.&#x20;

The inaugural `DAO` post mint will be responsible for the initialization of the `HOA`: including the election of an Interim President and Vice President, as well a temporary Board of Directors.&#x20;

## Proposals

The `DAO` will have regular opportunities for members to submit and vote on `proposals` for the future of the Blue Terra project. All `proposals` are managed through this Github [repo](https://github.com/Blue-Terra/blueterra-gitbook). `Proposals` can be thought of as a set of changes to:

The `Articles of Governance` for both the `HOA` and `DAO`

Consequently, the Blue Terra `DAO` has complete control over `HOA` and proposals are the mechanism by which Blue Terra `HOA` and `DAO` Governance. That is to say that, `DAO` `Proposals` may alter any of the text contained in the following [directory](https://github.com/Blue-Terra/blueterra-gitbook/blueterra-governance).&#x20;

Proposals have three stages:

1\) `compilation` - During this phase members of the `DAO` compile issues into a `proposal`. This `proposal` is compiled into a github branch containing these changes.&#x20;

2\) `voting` -  Member of the `DAO` are given a window of time to vote of issues in the `proposal`.

3\) `finalized` - After this given window of time, `DAO` the `proposal` is finalized and the github branch containing the finalized `proposal` is merged into the main branch of the repo.&#x20;

After the `proposal` is merged, the gitbook will be updated and the Governance of Blue Terra changes.&#x20;
