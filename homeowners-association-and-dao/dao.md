# 🌊 DAO

## Overview

After our mint, we will form a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, to serve as the governing body for our NFT holders and to select the initial officers of our Homeowner’s Association. Members of the DAO can colloquially be referred to as Terrans.&#x20;

## Formation

To qualify, one will simply need to hold a Blue Terra NFT in their Solana wallet. Exclusive Discord channels will be available through Grape Protocol.&#x20;

The inaugural DAO post mint will be responsible for the initialization of the homeowner’s association: including the election of an Interim President and Vice President, as well a temporary Board of Directors.&#x20;

## Governance

The DAO will have regular opportunities for members to submit and vote on proposals for the future of the Blue Terra project.&#x20;

We will also be dedicating a significant percentage of exchange fees from our upcoming secondary market back to the DAO, to give back to our community members and enable the Blue Terran DAO to create new value for our holders: be it through more communal land development, a validator node to stake to, marketing partnerships etc.
