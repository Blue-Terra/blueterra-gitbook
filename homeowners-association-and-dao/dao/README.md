# ðŸŒŠ DAO

## Overview

After our mint, we will form a decentralized autonomous organization, or `DAO`, to serve as the governing body for our NFT holders and to select the initial officers of our Home Ownerâ€™s Association(`HOA`). Members of the `DAO` can colloquially be referred to as Terrans.&#x20;

## Membership

To be a member of the `HOA`, holders would need to:

* Be a holder of a Blue Terra NFT (could not trade this NFT while a part of the organization)
* Be a committed community member
* Have experience in community management or relevant fields.

## DAO Formation

To qualify, one will simply need to hold a Blue Terra NFT in their Solana wallet. Exclusive Discord channels will be available through Grape Protocol.&#x20;

The inaugural `DAO` post mint will be responsible for the initialization of the `HOA`: including the election of an Interim President and Vice President, as well a temporary Board of Directors.&#x20;

## DAO Proposals

The `DAO` will have regular opportunities for members to submit and vote on proposals for the future of the Blue Terra project.&#x20;

We will also be dedicating a significant percentage of exchange fees from our upcoming secondary market back to the `DAO`, to give back to our community members and enable the Blue Terran `DAO` to create new value for our holders: be it through more communal land development, a validator node to stake to, marketing partnerships etc.

`DAO` proposals should be fully documented in this gitbook under `DAO`. On passing of a proposal it is the responsibility of&#x20;
