## Proposals

The DAO will have regular opportunities for members to submit and vote on proposals for the future of the Blue Terra project.&#x20;

We will also be dedicating a significant percentage of exchange fees from our upcoming secondary market back to the DAO, to give back to our community members and enable the Blue Terran DAO to create new value for our holders: be it through more communal land development, a validator node to stake to, marketing partnerships etc.
