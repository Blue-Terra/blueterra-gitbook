# üèñ Introduction

## Definitions

The way that land ownership and sale is traditionally structured in many countries is through a deed.&#x20;

In particular, a deed of conveyance. A deed is defined by Cornell Law as ‚Äú_a legal document that grants its holder ownership of a piece of real estate or other assets_‚Äù.&#x20;

A lease, on the other hand, is defined as ‚Äú_A contract between two people where one person with property (the lessor) allows the other (the leasee) to have use of that property for a limited period of time, in exchange for a payment_‚Äù.&#x20;

Last, a perpetual lease is simply a lease where the right to renew lies with the leasee, rather than the leasor as in a traditional lease.

## History

In The Bahamas, a lease is sometimes referred to as a deed of lease. We will henceforth refer to a deed of conveyance as a deed, and a deed of lease as a lease. We originally wanted to use a deed, and deed transfers are how many of the previous real estate transactions on OpenSea have operated through.&#x20;

However, there are a few major problems with deeds for a general framework of land ownership. First, deeds are expensive and subject to heavy taxation. Since deeds are the normal legal instrument through which asset transfer occurs, most centralized governments tax their transfer: typically through a realty transfer fee, as well as any consumption taxes that exist in the land‚Äôs legal jurisdiction. In The Bahamas, for example, there is a value-added tax (VAT) of 10%. This means that any time an NFT backed by a Bahamian deed is traded on a secondary market, the transaction is subject to a 10% tax. Similarly, the European Union has a standard VAT of at least 15% and Australia at 10%. On top of the transaction fees that usually go toward the creator (5%) and secondary market (2.5%) at the time of writing, these cumulative fees are prohibitively expensive for deeds to function as a seamless global solution to decentralized land transfer.

## Prelude

Although the possibilities of crypto and, recently, NFTs in the real estate market have been in the public space for some time now, the nascence of the industry has resulted in a relatively limited history. There have been a few examples of real commodities, such as Tungsten Cubes, and real property being sold on OpenSea. However, these transactions are often smaller, individual transfers and not at scale. To our knowledge, we are one of the first projects on blockchain to attempt to sell a large (100+ acres) amount of land through NFT tethered ownership.

This is uniquely possible through our model of using a freehold lease to distribute perpetual leases to all of our holders. The model we employ is actually fairly simple and therefore we hope is applicable to many areas of the world, not just in The Bahamas.&#x20;
