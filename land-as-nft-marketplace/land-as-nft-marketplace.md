# üè¶ Land As NFT Marketplace

## Value Proposition

‚ÄúThe Terra Bazaar‚Äù will be the first land trading NFT marketplace in existence. Our belief is that creating a liquid marketplace for decentralized land sale is a crucial component of DeFi in order to give people the freedom to access all asset classes.&#x20;

Land is an important real asset and hedge against inflation. Its potential both as a source of passive income and as foundation to build on lend to its stability as an asset. We realized quickly into this project that we would need to create our own platform eventually, as there are key features that uniquely must be implemented to provide necessary information about the land.&#x20;

## The Product

This marketplace will be a secular platform including its own listing capabilities, convenient built-in KYC verification, and legal contract requirements. This will be somewhat similar to current secondary NFT marketplaces but with additional features like multiple photos of the land, an updated estimated property tax, and detailed information about the property: furnishings, utilities, full lot size, etc.&#x20;

## Fee Structure

The Terra Bazaar will be taking a 2% exchange fee. 80% of the fee will be used to continuously update iterations of the marketplace as well as handle maintenance of existing attributes. 20% of the market place will be given back to the Blue Terran DAO to furthering the Blue Terran mission and supporting our holders: for example, through contributions for communal development or maintenance.&#x20;

## Upcoming Partnerships

Blue Terra will be partnering with real estate firms around the world in order to verify all of the properties on the marketplace. The real estate agents will be collecting a commission on the sale that will not exceed 5%. Additionally, agents will work on a variable pay model to encourage high quality verification. Blue Terra and its parent organization are Bahamian based companies and not required to disclose any information to foreign governments about our users‚Äô purchases and account details.
